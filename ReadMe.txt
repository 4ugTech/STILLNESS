Game Walkthrough:
The goal is to escape the facility which is under lockdown with no power. There are guards and monsters to watch out for. Guards are trying to control the situation and will shoot on site. Use the core game mechanic of standing still to slow down time to maneuver your way around the enemies/bullets. Once awoken, you must locate the key to exit the spawn room into the hallway. Then, you need to go into the various rooms to find the keycards to enter more rooms along with the double doors at the end to escape. There are collectibles such as a flashlight, batteries, syringe, keycards, key, and lore notes to read. Once in the hallways, you must navigate your way to find the exit doors which wins the game by escaping (requires black keycard). There are other explorable rooms connected in the hallway.
